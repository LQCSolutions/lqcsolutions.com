                <p><strong>Modelling the real world: reliably and at scale.</strong></p>
                <p>We design and implement quantitative models that capture the essential behavior of complex systems. Whether you're modeling physical processes, engineered systems, or data-driven phenomena, we build models grounded in first principles and informed by data.</p>
                <p>We specialize in PDE-based modeling and simulation, with experience in scalable implementations using tools like FEniCS (finite elements), OpenFOAM (finite volumes), and custom solvers. Our work spans deterministic and stochastic systems, hybrid physics-ML architectures, and multiscale formulations. All built for accuracy, robustness, and real-world relevance.</p>

                <p><strong>Unlocking the Value in Your Scientific Data.</strong></p>
                <p>From physical measurements to simulation results, data is ubiquitous â€” but classical models often fall short. They may miss complex dynamics or demand prohibitive compute time and resources. To overcome these challenges, we build custom machine learning models tailored to your scientific application.</p>
                <p>Our work draws on the emerging field of scientific machine learning (SciML), where first-principles physics meets data-driven modeling. Whether you're developing a fast surrogate for a numerical solver, constructing a digital twin of a complex system, or learning unknown dynamics from experimental data, we train models that are accurate, efficient, and physically grounded.</p>
                <p>Use cases include real-time prediction, steady-state estimation, design optimization, and uncertainty quantification - all enhanced through ML for science.</p>

We specialize in creating methods that are tightly aligned with the structure and demands of your problem, not some generic off-the-shelf tools.</p>
                <p>Our expertise spans fast linear and nonlinear solvers, domain-specific PDE discretizations, adaptive time-stepping, and particle-based simulation methods. We also build scalable surrogate models, customized ML optimizers, advanced sampling techniques, and uncertainty quantification workflows for both deterministic and stochastic systems.</p>
                <p>From multiscale dynamics to PDE-constrained optimization, we develop robust computational tools that enable deeper insight and better performance, all grounded in scientific rigor and algorithmic innovation.
