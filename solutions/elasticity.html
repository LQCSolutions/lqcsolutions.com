    <h2>Learning to Solve Elasticity Equations with Neural Operators</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Structural simulations are essential in engineering and material science. From stress analysis in mechanical parts to predicting deformation in biomaterials, knowing how a material will deform under a load
      without doing the actual experiment can significantly speed up the design cycle. Traditional finite-element solvers are highly accurate but computationally expensive when simulating the same equations under many different loads material properties.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">At LQC, we've developed a Neural Operator (NO) that can <strong>instantly predict the complete material displacement</strong> under any applied stress. This approach bypasses the need to re-solve the PDE for each new input.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">Our Neural Operator is based on a <strong>DeepONet architecture</strong> (see picture on the left) with additional convolutional layers in the branch network. Convolutions allow the branch to efficiently encode spatial patterns in the input load. The trunk network learns a compact representation of spatial locations, enabling rapid evaluation of the displacement field over the whole domain.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">
      Our model generalizes across a wide class of input forces, producing accurate predictions at a fraction of the computational cost of standard solvers.
      <strong>The comparison below</strong> illustrates how the neural operator matches the accuracy of traditional FEM while delivering results orders of magnitude faster.
      This makes it ideal for real-time simulation, optimization, and uncertainty quantification tasks.
