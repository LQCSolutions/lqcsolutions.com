    <h2>Learning to Solve Elasticity Equations with Neural Operators</h2>
    <p><strong>Structural simulations are essential</strong> in engineering and material science — from stress analysis in mechanical parts to predicting deformation in biomaterials. Traditional solvers for linear elasticity equations, such as finite element methods, are accurate but computationally intensive when simulating many different force fields or material properties.</p>

    <p>At <strong>LQC Solutions</strong>, we've developed a <strong>neural operator</strong> that learns to <strong>instantly predict full-field solutions</strong> to 2D linear elasticity problems — bypassing the need to re-solve the PDE for each new input.</p>

    <p>Our model is based on a <strong>DeepONet architecture enhanced with convolutional layers</strong> in the branch network, allowing it to efficiently encode spatial patterns in the input forcing. The trunk network learns a compact representation of spatial locations, enabling rapid evaluation of the displacement field across the domain.</p>

    <p><strong>The results are compelling</strong>: once trained, our model generalizes across a wide class of input forces, producing accurate predictions at a fraction of the computational cost of standard solvers. This makes it ideal for real-time simulation, optimization loops, and uncertainty quantification tasks.</p>
