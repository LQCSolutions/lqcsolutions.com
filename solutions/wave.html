    <h2>Finite Element Wave Propagation Suite in Python</h2>
    <p class="intro-text">Determining how waves propagate through air and solid materials is a huge part of modern communications and mechanical engineering. This includes acoustic waves, electro-magnetic waves and elastodynamic waves through solid materials and the deformations they cause.</p>

    <p class="intro-text">For this project, we built one big wave propagation and analysis suite in python, based on a unified PDE representation of these three kinds of waves. Based on this unified model, we wrote a general finite element simulator on top of FeniCS for all kinds of 3D geometries and boundary conditions.
